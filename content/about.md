Born on November 2, 1970, in Upper Silesia, Poland.

Wiola graduated from the State High School of Fine Arts in Bielsko Biała (specialty: artistic silk-screen printing) and the University of Silesia, Institute of Art in Cieszyn – her diploma was titled “Light” in the painting studio of Professor Tadeusz Rus, and her humanities work “Solar symbolism of Ancient Egypt and its manifestations in art” was supervised by Professor Adam Jonkisz.

_“I orbit around various painting themes, and I equally appreciate figurative motifs as well as abstract formless shapes.
Sometimes, I combine both genres by adding an unreal space to human figures. The ever-growing collection of works demanded systematization. I work in series such as: Solar, Underwater, Dance, Angelic, In the garden, and Abstract. It does not matter in which of my own groups the painting is found – what’s important is that it contains the idea I am guided by, so that what comes out from under my brushes and spatulas is a carrier of the sunny side of life.“_
